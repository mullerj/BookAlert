Comic Alert
=========

Comic Alert allows a comic book reader to be notified when a comic book of interest is available at a local comic book store.  
A comic book reader posts comic book titles that they are interested in. 
When a relevant comic book is available from a comic book store, the comic book reader receives an alert.
The comic book store rep enters comic books as they are received (via barcode scan or manual entry).
